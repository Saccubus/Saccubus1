# Ridiculously simple test of the os.startfile function for Windows.

# empty.vbs is an empty file (except for a comment), which does
# nothing when run with cscript or wscript.
#
# A possible improvement would be to have empty.vbs do something that
# we can detect here, to make sure that not only the os.startfile()
# call succeeded, but also the the script actually has run.
