    """Return a list of nodes in topological sort order.

    A topological sort is a nonunique permutation of the nodes
    such that an edge from u to v implies that u appears before v in the
    topological sort order.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX digraph
       A directed graph

    nbunch : container of nodes (optional)
       Explore graph in specified order given in nbunch

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
       Topological sort is defined for directed graphs only. If the
       graph G is undirected, a NetworkXError is raised.

    NetworkXUnfeasible
       If G is not a directed acyclic graph (DAG) no topological sort
       exists and a NetworkXUnfeasible exception is raised.

    Notes
    -----
    This algorithm is based on a description and proof in
    The Algorithm Design Manual [1]_ .
