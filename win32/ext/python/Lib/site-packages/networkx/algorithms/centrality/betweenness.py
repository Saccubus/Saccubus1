    """Compute the shortest-path betweenness centrality for nodes.

    Betweenness centrality of a node :math:`v` is the sum of the
    fraction of all-pairs shortest paths that pass through :math:`v`:

    .. math::

       c_B(v) =\\sum_{s,t \\in V} \\frac{\\sigma(s, t|v)}{\\sigma(s, t)}

    where :math:`V` is the set of nodes,
    :math:`\\sigma(s, t)` is the number of shortest :math:`(s, t)`-paths, 
    and :math:`\\sigma(s, t|v)` is the number of those paths
    passing through some  node :math:`v` other than :math:`s, t`. 
    If :math:`s = t`, :math:`\\sigma(s, t) = 1`,
    and if :math:`v \\in {s, t}`,  :math:`\\sigma(s, t|v) = 0` [2]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A NetworkX graph 
    normalized : bool, optional  
      If True the betweenness values are normalized by
      :math:`1/(n-1)(n-2)` where :math:`n` is the number of nodes in G.
    weighted_edges : bool, optional  
      Consider the edge weights in determining the shortest paths.
      The edge weights must be greater than zero.
      If False, all edge weights are considered equal.
    endpoints : bool, optional  
      If True include the endpoints in the shortest path counts.

    Returns
    -------
    nodes : dictionary
       Dictionary of nodes with betweenness centrality as the value.

    See Also
    --------
    edge_betweenness_centrality
    load_centrality

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm is from Ulrik Brandes [1]_.
    See [2]_ for details on algorithms for variations and related metrics.

    For weighted graphs the edge weights must be greater than zero.
    Zero edge weights can produce an infinite number of equal length 
    paths between pairs of nodes.
