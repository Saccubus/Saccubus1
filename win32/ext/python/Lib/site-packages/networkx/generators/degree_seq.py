def configuration_model(deg_sequence,create_using=None,seed=None):
    """Return a random graph with the given degree sequence.

    The configuration model generates a random pseudograph (graph with
    parallel edges and self loops) by randomly assigning edges to
    match the given degree sequence.

    Parameters
    ----------
    deg_sequence :  list of integers 
        Each list entry corresponds to the degree of a node.
    create_using : graph, optional (default MultiGraph)
       Return graph of this type. The instance will be cleared.
    seed : hashable object, optional
        Seed for random number generator.   

    Returns
    -------
    G : MultiGraph
        A graph with the specified degree sequence.
        Nodes are labeled starting at 0 with an index
        corresponding to the position in deg_sequence.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError

    Notes
    -----
    As described by Newman [1]_.

    A non-graphical degree sequence (not realizable by some simple
    graph) is allowed since this function returns graphs with self
    loops and parallel edges.  An exception is raised if the degree
    sequence does not have an even sum.

    This configuration model construction process can lead to
    duplicate edges and loops.  You can remove the self-loops and
    parallel edges (see below) which will likely result in a graph
    that doesn't have the exact degree sequence specified.  This
    "finite-size effect" decreases as the size of the graph increases.

    The algorithm::

     STEP 0 - Initialization
     A = {0}
     B = {1, 2, 3, ..., n}
     O = {(i; j), ..., (k, l),...} where i < j, i <= k < l and 
             d_i * d_j >= d_k *d_l 
     wA = d_1
     dB = sum(degrees)

     STEP 1 - Link selection
     (a) If |O| = 0 TERMINATE. Return graph A.
     (b) Select element(s) (i, j) in O having the largest d_i * d_j , if for 
             any i or j either w_i = 0 or w_j = 0 delete (i, j) from O
     (c) If there are no elements selected go to (a).
     (d) Select the link (i, j) having the largest value w_i (where for each 
             (i, j) w_i is the smaller of w_i and w_j ), and proceed to STEP 2.

     STEP 2 - Link addition
     Type 1: i in A and j in B. 
             Add j to the graph A and remove it from the set B add a link 
             (i, j) to the graph A. Update variables:
             wA = wA + d_j -2 and dB = dB - d_j
             Decrement w_i and w_j with one. Delete (i, j) from O
     Type 2: i and j in A.
         Check Tree Condition: If dB = 2 * |B| - wA. 
             Delete (i, j) from O, continue to STEP 3
         Check Disconnected Cluster Condition: If wA = 2. 
             Delete (i, j) from O, continue to STEP 3
         Add the link (i, j) to the graph A 
         Decrement w_i and w_j with one, and wA = wA -2
     STEP 3
         Go to STEP 1


    The article states that the algorithm will result in a maximal s-metric. 
    This implementation can not guarantee such maximality. I may have 
    misunderstood the algorithm, but I can not see how it can be anything 
    but a heuristic. Please contact me at sundsdal@gmail.com if you can 
    provide python code that can guarantee maximality.
    Several optimizations are included in this code and it may be hard to read.
    Commented code to come.

    A POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE:

    For an 'unconstrained' graph, that is one they describe as having
    the sum of the degree sequence be even(ie all undirected graphs) they
    present a simpler algorithm. It is as follows

        "For each vertex i: if di is even then attach di/2 self-loops;
        if di is odd, then attach (di-1)/2 self-loops, leaving one
        available "stub". Second for all remaining vertices with "stubs"
        connect them in pairs according to decreasing values of di."[1]
    
    Since this only works for undirected graphs anyway, perhaps this is
    the better method? Note this also returns a graph with a larger
    s_metric than the other method, and it seems to have the same
    degree sequence, though I haven't tested it extensively.
